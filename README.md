Repository created in preparation for the S&P global technical interview.

In order to use this repo firstly use git clone and cd into the local repo. After that use npm install in order to install the jest dependency for testing. You may then use npm run test if you wish to run the tests.

Each test was created for a single behavior. I began by testing for the most simple behavior. Before attempting to solve each test, I made the test fail to ensure there were no human errors within the testing.
